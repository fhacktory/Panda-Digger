Playlist intelligente sur base de moodbar(s)

A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, Gavin Wood and Simon O'Keefe from the Univerity of York invented the moodbar. It was designed to facilitate navigation on music.

It was first designed for [Amarok](https://amarok.kde.org/en) and it was later included in many other music players (like [Exaile](http://www.exaile.org/), [XMMS2](https://xmms2.org/wiki/Main_Page) and [clementine](https://www.clementine-player.org/)).
